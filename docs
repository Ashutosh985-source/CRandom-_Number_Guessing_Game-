2. Abstract
This project develops a random number guessing game in C that demonstrates core programming concepts including control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, structures, dynamic memory, and file handling. The game generates a random number, processes user guesses with feedback, tracks attempts dynamically, and manages high scores persistently via files.

3. Problem Definition
The objective is to create an interactive game where the user guesses a randomly generated number (1-100). The program provides hints, counts guesses, stores guess history dynamically, handles invalid inputs, and maintains a high score leaderboard saved to a file. This integrates all course units for a comprehensive application.

4. System Design (Flowcharts, Algorithms)
Algorithm:
- Load high scores from file using pointers and display sorted list.
- Seed random generator and pick number.
- Loop: Read guess (handle invalid with scanf check), store in dynamic array (realloc), provide feedback, increment attempts.
- On success: Display attempts and guess history (array).
- Get name, create Player struct, append to file.
- Free all allocated memory.

Flowchart: [Describe or insert image: Start -> Load Scores -> Display -> Game Loop (Guess -> Check -> Feedback) -> Win -> Save Score -> End]

5. Implementation Details (with snippets)
// Example: Dynamic array for guesses
if (attempts > capacity) {
    capacity = attempts * 2;
    guesses = realloc(guesses, capacity * sizeof(int));
}
// Structure and file I/O
typedef struct { char name[50]; int guesses; } Player;
fprintf(fp, "%s %d\n", p.name, p.guesses);

The code is modular: main.c handles entry, game.c contains logic. Headers in include/.

6. Testing & Results
Test Case 1: Valid guesses (input: 50, 75, 63 for number 63) -> Output: Too low, Too high, Correct in 3 attempts.
Test Case 2: Invalid input (input: abc, 50) -> Output: Invalid input, then proceed.
Test Case 3: High scores - After multiple runs, loads and sorts correctly, no crashes.
Handles edge cases: 1 guess win, max attempts, file not found.

7. Conclusion & Future Work
The project successfully integrates C concepts into a functional game. Future enhancements: Multi-player mode, difficulty levels, GUI integration.
